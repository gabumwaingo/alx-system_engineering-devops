Explanation:

Additional Elements and their Purpose:
- Two servers: To ensure redundancy and high availability in case one server fails.
- Load Balancer (HAproxy): To evenly distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers, improving scalability and handling high traffic loads.
- Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster: To provide fault tolerance and data replication for better data availability and reliability.

Load Balancer Configuration:
- The load balancer is configured with the Round Robin algorithm.
- The Round Robin algorithm evenly distributes incoming requests to each web server in a sequential manner.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
- The infrastructure is configured with an Active-Active setup.
- In an Active-Active setup, both web servers are actively serving requests simultaneously, improving performance and scalability.
- In contrast, an Active-Passive setup would involve one web server actively serving requests while the other acts as a backup, remaining idle until failover is required.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster:
- The Primary-Replica cluster consists of a Primary Node and a Replica Node.
- The Primary Node handles read and write operations, serving as the main database server.
- The Replica Node replicates data from the Primary Node and serves as a backup.
- The Replica Node can be used for failover purposes if the Primary Node fails, ensuring data availability.

Issues with this infrastructure:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
  - Despite having multiple servers, certain components like the load balancer or database cluster may still be SPOFs if they are not properly configured or redundant.
- Security Issues:
  - The infrastructure lacks a firewall, which can expose it to potential security threats.
  - HTTPS (SSL/TLS) is not implemented, leading to insecure data transmission.
- No Monitoring:
  - The infrastructure lacks monitoring tools to track server performance, detect issues, and ensure proactive maintenance.

To address these issues, you could consider implementing firewall rules, enabling HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates, and incorporating monitoring tools to ensure the health and security of the infrastructure.
