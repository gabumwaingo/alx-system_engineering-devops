Explanation:
1. User wanting to access the website:
   - The user enters the URL www.foobar.com in their web browser.

2. Server:
   - A server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts and serves the website.
   - It handles incoming requests from users and responds with the appropriate web content.

3. Domain Name:
   - A domain name, such as foobar.com, serves as the address for the website.
   - It provides a human-readable name that corresponds to the server's IP address.
   - In this case, we configure the www record in the DNS to point to the server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

4. DNS Record:
   - The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain and represents the web server for the website.
   - The DNS record maps the subdomain (www) to the server's IP address.
   - Users can access the website by using the URL www.foobar.com.

5. Web Server (Nginx):
   - The web server's role is to handle incoming HTTP requests and serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the users.
   - Nginx is a popular web server software known for its high performance and scalability.
   - It listens for requests on port 80 (HTTP) and routes them to the appropriate components.

6. Application Server:
   - The application server runs the server-side code of the website.
   - It processes dynamic requests, interacts with databases, and generates dynamic content.
   - It communicates with the web server to handle requests that require dynamic processing.
   - The server-side code (your code base) resides on the application server.

7. Database (MySQL):
   - The database stores and manages the website's data.
   - MySQL is a popular relational database management system.
   - It handles data storage, retrieval, and querying for the website's application.
   - The application server communicates with the database server to fetch and store data.

8. Server communication with the user's computer:
   - When a user requests the website, their computer sends an HTTP request over the Internet.
   - The request travels through various network devices until it reaches the server.
   - The server processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the user's computer using HTTP.

Issues with this infrastructure:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
   - Since we have a single server, if it goes down or experiences issues, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
   - There is no redundancy or failover mechanism to ensure high availability.

- Downtime during maintenance:
   - Performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updating server configurations, may require restarting the web server.
   - During this restart process, the website may become temporarily unavailable to users.

- Limited scalability:
   - The infrastructure may not handle a significant increase in incoming traffic.
   - With a single server, there may be performance bottlenecks, and the website's responsiveness may degrade under heavy loads.

To address these issues and improve the infrastructure, you could consider implementing a load balancer, using multiple servers for redundancy and scalability, and implementing a caching layer to optimize performance.
